The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on the economy in the United States. In early March 2020, the first lockdowns began and the stock market plunged. After this initial reaction, however, the market recovered.   


In this project, you will use online investment advice that was available at the beginning of July 2020. to make investment decisions and then track your investments through the fall until 1 December. Many R packages could be used for this project. 

There are many R resources for investment analysis. Google "cran r stock investments," for a selection.

I demonstrated the tidyquant n class, showing the initial plunge in early March 2020 through June 2020 when the Market recovered.
